### This web app utilizes the following tools:

 

* React Router
* Express.js
* MongoDB
* Material UI
* Heroku hosting

### New accomplishments with this project:
* Integrate MongoDB with React
* Retrieve data with a key from an external API (Bible Search API)
* Create and use a proxy URL (with Heroku) to access external API 
* Configure MongoDB in an Atlas cloud database
* Application performance monitoring with New Relic

(note: The database was originally configured on a local MongoDB database as seen in commented out code)
