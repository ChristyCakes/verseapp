# Ethos
### Ethos App displays various emotions as buttons on a screen. When an emotion is clicked, a relevant Bible verse appears in a modal. The goal of Verse App is to provide quick access to Biblical wisdom, comfort, and truth in emotional moments.
### This web app utilizes the following tools:

* React Router
* Express.js
* MongoDB
* Material UI

### New accomplishments with this project:
* Integrate MongoDB with React
* Retrieve data with a key from an external API (Bible Search API)
* Create and use a proxy URL (with Heroku) to access external API 
* Configure MongoDB in an Atlas cloud database

(note: The database was originally configured on a local MongoDB database as seen in commented out code)
