### Ethos App displays various emotions as buttons on a screen. When an emotion is clicked, a relevant Bible verse appears in a modal. The goal of Ethos is to provide a meaningful experience from a quick snippet of Biblical wisdom, comfort, and truth in emotional moments. Each proverb modal also includes 'thumbs up' and 'thumbs down' buttons that record user feedback.
